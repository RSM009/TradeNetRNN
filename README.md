# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Dive into the world of predicting stock prices with our Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning project! Navigating the ups and downs of the financial markets is no easy feat, but we've got your back. Our project taps into the latest and greatest Machine Learning wizardry to sift through historical stock data, spot trends, and shoot out smart predictions for what's coming next.

# Overview
## Data Magic
We're digging into historical stock data to uncover the secrets it holds. Think of it as detective work, but for your investments.

## Machine Learning Wizardry
We've got the cool stuff – think algorithms like Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. They're like the superheroes of predicting stock prices.

## Real-time Action
We're not living in the past. Our project stays on the ball with real-time market data. Your predictions? Always fresh and up-to-the-minute.

## Scoreboard Check
We're not hiding anything. Check out how well our models are doing with easy-to-understand metrics. Accuracy, precision, recall – we've got it all laid out.



# Additional Points
## 1. Theoretical Knowledge
Understanding the theoretical aspects of stock price prediction is crucial. Dive into concepts such as time series analysis, statistical models, and financial indicators. Our project not only provides practical results but also serves as a learning resource to grasp the underlying theories driving stock price predictions.

## 2. Tools for RNN used in Trading Python
When it comes to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in trading, Python offers a powerful ecosystem. We leverage popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch for implementing RNNs in our project. These tools provide a robust framework for building and training sophisticated neural networks tailored for stock price prediction. Additionally, we explore specialized financial libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and analysis. The documentation within our project will guide you through the implementation details using these tools
